# workflow

### 1. What problems does it solve and how does it solve them?

To quote our site...

"Preparing for interviews is stressfull enough without worrying about scheduling. We’ll tell you when to be where and when to follow up after your interviews."

"Match your contacts to perspective employers. After all, it’s all about who you know."

"You’re sending out dozens of applications per week. We have the tools to help you keep track of them all."

### 2. Who has this problem?

While any job searcher could have this problem, workflow will be most beneficial to someone who is applying for many jobs and needs to keep track of all of them. As of now, it is specifically geared towards the tech industry.

### 3. What web APIs does it use?

Workflow uses the Linkedin API for Oauth and the Google Maps API.

### 4. What technologies does it use?

* Babel
* Brunch
* CSS3
* Express
* Heroku
* HTML5
* Joi
* JS (ES6)
* JSX
* Knex
* Material-UI
* Node.js
* Postgresql
* React
* SASS

### 5. What was the most valuable user feedback?

Our initial users pointed out that most of our button colors made them look disabled.

They also helped us streamline the user flow and condense several components into one "dashboard" where a user can access and edit all of their job information.

### 6. What was the biggest technical challenge?

We were challenged by making nested asynchronous database requests.

We made use of the material-ui date and time picker components to add interview dates and times to a user's account. There are seven of each of those components in each job component. Parsing and sending the date and time data was a major challenge.

### 7. What lessons did your team learn as a result of your collaboration?

We learned what's going to work... TEAMWORK!

We learned how two team members can each make fully encapsulated components that can then be used by other members of the team in other parts of the code. This was beneficial when one of us spent a lot of time and energy building a challenging component and that work and effort could be plugged in elsewhere without having to rewrite or repeat any code.
